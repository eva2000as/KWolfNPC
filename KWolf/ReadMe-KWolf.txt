This is a new NPC as well as a store. He will join your party if you are a certain level or higher. He also has his own store. You cannot access his store items if he is in your party. There is a way to incorporate that function but I removed it as it doesn't seem realistic to be able to access his store while out in the middle of nowhere. His original spot is upstairs in the Five Flagons Inn(ar0511). If you do use him in your party and then drop him, he will go the the Five Flagons. When using his store, you will notice that most of the items are not identified. That is because they are from another game called Fallout. If you know what they are, then purchase them, if not, have fun discovering what they are!
