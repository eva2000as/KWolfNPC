Due to my poor English, I won't show off. The following is entirely translated from Chinese to English by an AI. And since I've just started using Github... Ahem, please forgive my messing around.

This is a mod for Baldur's Gate 2 SOA called KillWolfNpc. Of course, it can now run on BGEE, thanks to the original author inintrag and all the translators, as well as Badgert who re-uploaded it to SHS. Here is the original file download page on SHS:
http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/136-killing-wolf-npc/

It's just a simple EE adaptation upgrade, and now all language files have been modified to UTF-8 encoding. In theory, since the NPC can spawn normally (on the second floor of the Five Flagons Inn in Athkatla Bridge District) and engage in dialogue and trade, I won't change any of the original code, items, images... and so on.

Of course, if you encounter any problems, you can let me know. I'm not a BG2 modder, but I'll try to fix it a bit.

Have fun playing.

This is a new NPC as well as a store. He will join your party if you are a certain level or higher. He also has his own store. You cannot access his store items if he is in your party. There is a way to incorporate that function but I removed it as it doesn't seem realistic to be able to access his store while out in the middle of nowhere. His original spot is upstairs in the Five Flagons Inn(ar0511). If you do use him in your party and then drop him, he will go the the Five Flagons. When using his store, you will notice that most of the items are not identified. That is because they are from another game called Fallout. If you know what they are, then purchase them, if not, have fun discovering what they are!
